# Social Media Feed

## Overview
This is a simple social media feed application that allows users to register, log in, create posts, like/unlike posts, and add comments. Users can also sort posts based on popularity and view their own posts separately. The project utilizes React for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MySQL for persistent data storage.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Registration and login functionality.
- **Post Feed**: Displays a list of posts with user details, post content, likes, and comments.
- **Like/Unlike Posts**: Users can like or unlike posts by clicking the "Like" button.
- **Commenting**: Users can add and view comments on posts.
- **Create Posts**: Users can create and add new posts to the feed, including image uploads.
- **Sorting & Filtering**:
  - Sort posts based on popularity (likes/comments).
  - Display a user's own posts separately.
- **React State Management**: Utilizes React state to manage posts, likes, and comments dynamically.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend

- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Used for styling and UI components.
